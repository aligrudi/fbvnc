FBVNC
=====

Fbvnc is a small VNC client for Linux framebuffer.  Without arguments,
it connects to port 5900 of 127.0.0.1.  For the list of possible
options, invoke it with the -h option.  Once connected, it sends
keyboard and mouse inputs to the VNC server and updates the screen
when necessary.  The following keys are not sent to the server.

==============	===================================
KEY		ACTION
==============	===================================
ctrl-space	Send text buffer to the server
ctrl-alt-c	Exit fbvnc
==============	===================================

Fbvnc stops updating the screen when it receives the SIGUSR1 signal.
If it receives SIGUSR2 after that, it continues updating the screen as
usual.

To copy text between the server and the client, it is necessary to
specify the address of a file with the -c option.  When the VNC server
sends a cut text message (probably when some text is selected), the
text is written to this file.  Also, when ctrl-space is pressed, the
contents of this file is sent to the server via a cut text message.

When using fbvnc with fbpad, it is usually a good idea to list the tag
in which fbvnc is run in TAGS_SAVED (the scrsnap feature), so that
when switching back to the tag, its old contents are shown.  Also, it
is possible to disable drawing when switching from the terminal in
which fbvnc is run, and to enable it when switching back (this
prevents screen updates by fbvnc, when another terminal is shown).
To do so, execute the shell in fbpad using m-; (not the usual m-c), to
enable terminal switching signals.
