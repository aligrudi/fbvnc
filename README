FBVNC
=====

Fbvnc is a small VNC client for Linux framebuffer.  It can be invoked
as follows.

  $ fbvnc host port

Without arguments, it connects to port 5900 of 127.0.0.1.  Once
connected, it sends keyboard and mouse inputs to the VNC server and
updates the screen when necessary.  The following keys are not sent to
the server.

==============	===================================
KEY		ACTION
==============	===================================
ctrl-space	Stop/continue updating the screen
ctrl-alt-c	Exit fbvnc
==============	===================================

When using fbvnc with fbpad, it is usually a good idea to list the tag
in which fbvnc is run in TAGS_SAVED (the scrsnap feature), so that
when switching back to the tag, its old contents are shown.  Also, it
is possible to disable drawing when switching from the terminal in
which fbvnc is run, and to enable it when switching back (instead of
using ctrl-space manually each time).  To do so, execute the shell in
fbpad using m-; (not the usual m-c), to enable terminal switching
signals.
